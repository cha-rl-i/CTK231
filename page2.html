  <h1>Second Image</h1>
  <h2>Charlie Reagan</h2>

  <img src="Posters.png" alt="Posters" width="400">
  <p>This is the second image. This has the same art style as the first picture but this picture just shows a man holding a poster that says "poster" on it. I really like this one, as well, because of the art style. </p>
